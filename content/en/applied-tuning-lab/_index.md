  My personal journey through driving, tuning, learning, and
  applying the tools I'm building to improve performance lap by lap.

This section is where theory meets tarmac. I document what I learn as I apply telemetry analysis to actual driving and tuning in Forza Motorsport 7.

## The Approach

Every session generates data. The goal is to close the loop:

1. **Drive** - Record telemetry during practice or races
2. **Analyze** - Review data to find patterns and problems
3. **Adjust** - Make targeted setup changes based on evidence
4. **Validate** - Measure whether changes improved performance

This isn't about finding magic setups. It's about understanding *why* a car behaves the way it does and making informed decisions rather than guessing.

## What I'm Working On

**Current focus:**
- Learning to read tire temperature patterns
- Understanding suspension travel and its effect on grip
- Building intuition for correlating feel with data

**Captured knowledge:**
- 806 car specifications in the database
- 13+ recorded sessions for analysis
- Tuning guides being extracted into structured rules

## Why Document This?

Sim racing knowledge is scattered across forums, YouTube videos, and tribal wisdom. By documenting my learning process with real telemetry data, I hope to create something more systematic and reproducible.
