Welcome to **SC Tuning** — where data meets performance.

This repository serves as the **public-facing interface** of the SC Tuning ecosystem. It provides tools, calculators, and guides for players who want to access the benefits of telemetry-based tuning without having to study the raw internals.

## Purpose

**SC Tuning** delivers the curated, accessible layer of our system. It's where tuned cars, optimization tools, and competitive setups are published.

Our goal is to empower Forza Motorsport players with:
- Clean user interfaces
- Adaptive tuning calculators
- Real-world telemetry-informed setups

## What You Can Expect Here

- Web-based tuning tools (e.g., grip, acceleration, cat1/cat2 targeting)
- Community-ready tune packs and performance suggestions
- Guides for interpreting tuning concepts and competitive performance metrics

## When to Use This Repo

Use **sc-tuning-pro** if you:
- Want to *use* tuning tools (rather than study how they work)
- Are looking for ready-to-go tune setups
- Prefer interfaces and guides that skip the telemetry code
