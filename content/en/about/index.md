## The Project

SC Tuning combines two focus areas:

**AI + ML + Live Telemetry Systems** - Designing real-time pipelines, adaptive agents,
and ML systems for telemetry processing, time-series analysis, and performance insights.

**Forza Applied Tuning Lab** - Applying these tools to improve driving and tuning
in Forza Motorsport, lap by lap.
